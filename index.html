  <p>
    This is Redux but with one important change: all of the "business logic"
    is implemented on a separate worker thread. It might be stupid to do that
    for a single counter, but when you need to retrieve a bunch of data and
    process it before displaying, the hassle might just be worth it to keep
    the UI responsive even during long operations.
